# Key Components to Focus On

- **Next.js with the Pages Router**: This will handle your application's routing and page structure.
- **tRPC**: Facilitates type-safe communication between your frontend and backend.
- **Prisma**: Manages your database interactions.

# Practical Steps to Get Started

## Set Up Your Project
1. Initialize a new T3 app using the `create-t3-app` CLI.
2. Select **Next.js**, **tRPC**, and **Prisma** during setup.

## Define Your Database Schema with Prisma
1. In the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, define the models representing your data.
2. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply the schema to your database.

## Create tRPC Routers for Backend Logic
1. In the `src/server/api/routers` directory, define routers that handle your application's backend logic.
2. Use Prisma within these routers to interact with your database.

## Build Your Frontend Pages
1. In the `src/pages` directory, create React components for each page of your application.
2. Use tRPC hooks to fetch and manipulate data by calling your backend procedures.

# Example Workflow

### Adding a New Feature (e.g., Task Management)

1. **Database**: Define a `Task` model in your Prisma schema.
2. **Backend**: Create a tRPC router with procedures to add, retrieve, update, and delete tasks.
3. **Frontend**: Develop pages and components that utilize tRPC hooks to interact with your task-related backend procedures.
